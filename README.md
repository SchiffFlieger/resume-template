See the PDF version of the sample resume [here](sample-resume.pdf).

## Get it for yourself
You need to have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) running on your machine.
```
git clone
npm install
npm run serve
```

You can insert your own data in `config.js`. All changes will be hot-reloaded in your browser. 

To get your PDF file, use the [Chrome Browser](https://www.google.com/chrome) and print the website with the `Save as PDF` printer. 
Make sure to set `Margins` to `none` and activate the `Background graphics` option. 
You may need to tweak some padding/margin values for your resume to fit onto a single page.

If you have any questions, feel free to open an issue.
